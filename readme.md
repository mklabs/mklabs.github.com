2 years ago, I revamped my blog to use Jekyll and started to blog in
English rather than French: http://mkla.bz

But never really published anything apart an article on using Yeoman
together with Jekyll.

Today, I decided to rework a series of post (3) I never published (publish:
false), and finally publish them.

My old blog with french articles can still be found on my github at: https://github.com/mklabs/blog.mklog.fr
