My old blog with french articles can still be found on my github at:
http://mklabs.github.com/blog.mklog.fr

## Install

Grab dev dependencies

    npm install

## Tasks

    serve => should serve a jekyll preview (broken atm)
    browserify => builds search/search.js into search/bundle.js
    watchify => same but with watchify and livereactload

Example

    npm run browserify

I feel like I'll end up with a basic website with good old html + css
