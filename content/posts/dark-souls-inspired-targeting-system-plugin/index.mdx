I am happy to announce and talk here about an UE4 plugin I wrote recently. It is pretty basic and simple, but I feel like it is now fleshed out enough for me to share it.

This is a free and open-source plugin written entirely in C++ which adds support for a simple Dark Souls inspired Camera Lock On / Targeting system.

It was first developed and tested in Blueprints following the implementation of the people over at [Lurendium](http://www.lurendium.com), with this tutorial series: [Part 1](http://www.lurendium.com/target-system-similar-to-dark-souls/), [Part 2](http://www.lurendium.com/target-system-similar-dark-souls-blueprint-part-2/), [Part 3](http://www.lurendium.com/target-system-similar-to-dark-souls-blueprint-part-3-final/), and then converted and rewritten into a C++ module and plugin.
