My name is Mickael Daniel, a 34-year-old Gameplay developer from France.

I have a solid background in software development with 10 years experience working in the industry as a frontend / backend developer, specialized in JavaScript and nodejs development.

I now focus my efforts entirely on Gamedev with ***Unreal Engine 4*** with solid knowledge of the ***Gameplay Ability System***, ***Advanced Locomotion System***, ***Networking***, ***UI*** and pretty efficient in ***C++***
