Leveraging the power of the Gameplay Ability System, this plugin provides a starting point and a robust foundation to speed up the creation and development of GAS-based projects.

It includes the necessary C++ code and Blueprints to get started on a new project that aims to use Epic's GAS plugin (used namely in Fortnite and Paragon, and showcased in Action RPG project)

## Core Features

- **Provided as a Plugin** to easily share code between projects
- **Blueprint Friendly**, no need to dive into the cpp side, you can implement Abilities right away
- **C++ Friendly too!** You can easily extend from the provided C++ class or modify the plugin source.
    - GAS Companion aims to be a general base for GAS powered projects without making any game design choices. The system is intended to be subclassed and customized per project needs.
- **Not Game specific** The plugin doesn't make assumptions about your game design and decisions, and was built to be generic enough to be used in any kind of game.
- **Ability Queueing System** Store failed abilities and re-trigger when the previous running ability ends, with a custom Debug Widget to visualize the state of the Queueing System
- **Ignore Ability Cost for activation** Possibility to "loosely" check cost for Abilities, only checking for positive resource value, letting abilities activate even if attributes goes into negative values - but still prevents activation when value is 0 or below 0
