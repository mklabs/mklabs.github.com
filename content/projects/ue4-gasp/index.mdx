This is very first game / prototype I've developed in UE4. It is a basic 3rd person game, which is between the mechanics of an MMO and an ActionRPG.

It is actually implementing the game developed in [Introduction to Unreal Engine 4 Ability System course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/introduction-to-unreal-engine-4-ability-system/), with few additions and differences (sprint ability, tweaks to cost and effects, etc.)

The bulf of the gameplay revolves around going through tiles to tiles, defeating enemies to advance to the next stage.

It has notion of Procedural Generation with the generation of tiles and the placement of props within each tiles.

This is also with this project that I first implemented a Lock On / Target System implemented in Blueprints, which later became a Marketplace Asset when I rewrote it as a C++ Plugin.
