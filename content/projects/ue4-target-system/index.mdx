An UE4 plugin written entirely in C++ which adds support for a simple Dark Souls inspired Camera Lock On / Targeting system.

It was first developed and tested in Blueprints following the implementation of the people over at Lurendium, and then converted and rewritten into a C++ module and plugin.

Get it from the [marketplace](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/target-system-component-plugin) or download the latest `TargetSystem.zip` pre-built plugin zip from the [Release page](https://github.com/mklabs/ue4-targetsystemplugin/releases), and drop the content in your project's `Plugins` folder.

Then, load up Unreal Editor, check the Plugins page and see if `TargetSystem` plugin is enabled.

## Features

- Customizable with a set of options that can be overridden in Blueprints.
- Easy setup: only one Actor component to attach and a minimum of one functions to bind to input.
- Target closest enemy (Pawns by default, customizable with TargetableActors UPROPERTY).
- Break on Line of Sight when getting behind an object.
- Break Target when getting outside minimum distance to enable.
- Simple TargetLockedOn Widget included, can be customized / overridden.
- Option to control character rotation when locked on.
- Switch to new target with axis input (on mouse / gamepad axis movement).
- Two Blueprint implementable events on component on Target Locked On and Off.
- Adds a Pitch Offset at close range, the greater it is the closer the player gets to the target.

## Usage
