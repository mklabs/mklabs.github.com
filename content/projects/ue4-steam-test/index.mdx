Third person, melee combat, sword and shield, rolling / lock on system, and dual multiplayer. Makes two peoples fight each other and uses Steam Online Subsystem to host and join sessions.

This project also uses GAS to implement the combat system abilities (Light / Heavy attacks, block, roll, parry, ...)
